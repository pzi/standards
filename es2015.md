# Tooling

For projects that use ES2015, we use:

- [eslint](http://eslint.org)

To lint our JavaScript files.

# Ignores

The `.eslintignore` file contains only `node_modules` and whatever project specific folders as required.

# Styleguide

General points:

- Classes are PascalCased
- Functions are camelCased
- Spaces, not tabs
- Indent by two spaces
- Promises are indented
- Use `let` or `const` only (no `var`)

```
Promise
  .then(() => {})
  .catch(() => {})
```
