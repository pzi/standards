## Sass vs. SCSS

At TFG we have standardised on [Sass' indented syntax](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.INDENTED_SYNTAX.html) as it is more concise and shares the same indentation sensitive style of [HAML](http://haml.info/). This may be a point of contention as the Rails community and the Sass authors have standardised on the SCSS syntax due to its similarities to CSS and reduced learning curve, while we feel the addition of curly-braces and semicolons is superfluous.
